**Frontend**: EJS templates <br />
**Database**: PostgreSQL <br />
**Other Libraries**: <br />
  *bcrypt* for password hashing <br />
  *body-parser* for parsing request bodies <br />
  *dotenv* for environment variables <br />
  *express-session* for session management <br />
  *canvas.js* for generating graphs <br />
